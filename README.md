\
This project is a refactoring of a workday scheduler, one that allows a user to enter and save notes by the hour, in an interactive, color-coded format that scales with Moment.js timestamps. This repository utilizes jQuery & Bootstrap for formatting and functionality, taking advantage of local storage, and demonstrating event delegation in action.
